# File naming practices
* File names should be descriptive and short; no longer than 25 characters (roughlythisnumberofwords).
* Special characters should be avoided: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? 
* Do not use spaces, because they are not recognized by some software. Instead use capitals (FILENAME) underscores (file_name), dashes (file-name), no separation (filename), or camel case (FileName)
* Use the ISO 8601 date format: YYYYMMDD
* Write down naming convention in your data management plan
* For sequential numbering, use leading zeros to ensure files sort properly. For example, use “0001, 0002…1001, etc” instead of “1, 2…1001, etc.”

## Elements to consider when choosing file name
* Date of creation (putting the date in the front will facilitate computer aided date sorting)
* Short Description
* Author
* Location
* Project name or number
* Version number
